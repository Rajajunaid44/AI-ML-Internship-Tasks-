# AI & ML Internship Tasks

This repository contains the work I completed during my **AI & Machine Learning Internship** at **Developers Hub Corporation**.  
Over the course of the internship, I explored a variety of datasets, applied multiple machine learning algorithms, and visualized data insights using popular Python libraries.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Internship Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience with **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **machine learning models**.
- Work with real-world datasets from **Kaggle** and APIs like **yfinance**.
- Build and evaluate predictive models for different problem statements.
- Interpret and present key findings from data exploration.

---

## ðŸ“š Libraries & Tools Used
- **Python** (core language)
- **NumPy** â€“ numerical computations
- **Pandas** â€“ data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€“ data visualization
- **yfinance** â€“ fetching stock market data
- **scikit-learn** â€“ ML models & evaluation metrics

## ðŸ“‚ Tasks Overview

### **Task 1: Basic Data Exploration & Visualization**
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **Iris Dataset**.
- Used Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots).
- Learned to identify trends and distributions in data.

### **Task 2: Apple Stock Price Prediction**
- **Dataset**: Apple stock data fetched via `yfinance`.
- **Models Applied**:
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Linear Regression
- **Objective**: Predict short-term Apple stock closing prices.
- **Key Results**:
  - Random Forest MAE: ~0.94 USD, RÂ²: ~0.85
  - Linear Regression achieved slightly lower accuracy as 0.83.
- **Findings**:
  - Random Forest captured short-term trends better.
  - Visualization of predicted vs. actual prices showed a close fit.

### **Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction**
- **Dataset**: Heart Disease Prediction Dataset (Kaggle).
- **Models Applied**:
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- **Objective**: Classify patients as at risk or not at risk of heart disease.
- **Key Results**:
  - Achieved high accuracy on test data.
  - Feature importance showed that attributes like cholesterol, age, and max heart rate were strong indicators.
- **Findings**:
  - EDA revealed differences in key health metrics between heart disease patients and healthy individuals.

---

### **Task 6: House Price Prediction**
- **Dataset**: House Prices Dataset (Kaggle).
- **Model Applied**:
  - Linear Regression
- **Objective**: Predict sale prices of houses based on various features.
- **Key Results**:
  - Model performed well on clean, numeric data after preprocessing.
- **Findings**:
  - Location, overall quality, and living area size were the most influential factors.
